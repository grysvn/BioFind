Finds definitions for biology terms using the biology online dictionary (http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary).

I have multiple plans for this application in the future.  Here's a list:
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the definitions from biology-online so they look more presentable in a text document and not just garbled symbols (this happens occasionally).</li>
<li>Adding integration with my Define project to have multiple sources for definitions.</li>
<li>After the former is added, I'm going to work on a prioirty system so one source will be used before another.</li>
</ul>
